## Ansible Terms

Before we get into the important Ansible commands, first, let's understand its basic terminology.

Server: An entity that provides service for our Ansible

Machine: A physical machine, a VM, or a container Target machine: An end machine to be configured by Ansible

Task: An action

Playbook: A location where YAML files are written and executed YAML

As mentioned earlier, YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) is a human-readable programming language. YAML syntax is used to express the Ansible playbooks.

Here are some basic concepts of YAML.

Key/Value pair:
Dictionary is represented in key/value pairs.

Example:


```yml
james:
name: james john
rollNo: 34
div: B
sex: male
```

Representing lists:
Each element in a list has to be written in a new line with '-' as a prefix.

```yml
Example:
countries:
- America
- China
- Canada
- Iceland
```

Lists inside a dictionary:
We can have lists inside a dictionary.

Example

```yml
james:
name: james john
rollNo: 34
div: B

- maths
- physics
- english
```
